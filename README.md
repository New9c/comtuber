# Comtuber: the least tracking for the most expression C:
## Website!
Go to [comtuber.vercel.app](comtuber.vercel.app) to give it a shot! C:<br>
Deployed via vercel (duh).
## Running it locally
```sh
git clone https://github.com/New9c/comtuber
cd comtuber
python -m http.server <port_number>
```

`port_number` can be 8000, 7777 or something else, defaults to 8000 if not filled.<br>
Open <insert your browser> at `localhost:<port_number>` to check it out.

## IT'S FREE
If I didn't screw up the license, this is completely free! You can use this for commercial use, aka make money streaming with it. Hate something about this software? Fork the repo and make it better!
## About
I liked [veodotube mini](https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini), but it doesn't quite have the tracking I want, while Vtuber software is often more heavy and could actually be less expressive depending on the model.<br><br> 
Comtuber uses simple tracking to get your expressions and outputs an image or gif. This sort of turns the "slide-show" issue I had with vtuber software from a problem to a feature, being able to have a comical 0 to 100 expression change like animations/comics do. <br>
Exaggerated faces work great and are hilarious XD<br>
This is simply a highly modified version of this [MediaPipe demo](https://codepen.io/mediapipe-preview/pen/OJBVQJm).<br><br>
I made this because I want there to be more options for people to choose, not because Comtuber is better than pngtubing or vtubing (heck some may say comtuber is pngtubing?). Hopefully more software will be developed for streaming C:
